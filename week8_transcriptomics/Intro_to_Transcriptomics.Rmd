***Deliverables***
-Upload this R Notebook to your GitHub and submit the link to your Repo on Brightspace.
-Include any graphs or figures created in this assignment in the folder with your R notebook with descriptive file names.

Since this is an optional partner activity, it is okay if your answers are the same as your partnerâ€™s as long as everyone understands it and could explain it in their own words if asked. Each person must individually push their code to Github. *At the top of your R Notebook, write the name of you and your partner(s) as a comment.*

***Complete the following coding activity and answer any following questions as comments in your R Notebook***

In SummarizedExperiment Tutorial, you learned how to manipulate the SummarizedExperiment data structure and turn it into more readable dataframes, saving them as rna_counts, rna_clinical, and rna_genes. In this semi-guided assignment, you will use these dataframes to perform differential expression analysis based on tumor status.

*Pre-Assignment*
Use knitr function to set your working directory to your analysis_data folder in 490_cluster.
```{r setup}
 knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = normalizePath("/home1/kehuffma/490_cluster/analysis_data"))
```

If DESeq2 is not already installed, install it now
```{r}
if (!require("DESeq2", quietly = TRUE))
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")

if (!require("EnhancedVolcano", quietly = TRUE))
BiocManager::install("EnhancedVolcano")
```

Load in all necessary packages
```{r}
# install, only if needed, and load packages (SummarizedExperiment and TCGAbiolinks)
library(TCGAbiolinks)
library(SummarizedExperiment)
library(DESeq2)
library(EnhancedVolcano)

# Load in the RNAseq data
rna_query <- GDCquery(project ="TCGA-BRCA",
                      data.category = "Transcriptome Profiling",
                      data.type = "Gene Expression Quantification",
                      workflow.type = "STAR - Counts")

GDCdownload(rna_query)
rna_se <- GDCprepare(rna_query)

```



*1*
Read in the rna_clinical, rna_genes, and rna_counts dataframes which you made in the "SummarizedExperiment Guided Tutorial" R Notebook

```{r} 
# Read rna_clinical
rna_clinical <- rna_se@colData
rna_clinical <- as.data.frame(rna_clinical)

# Read rna_counts
rna_counts <- rna_se@assays@data$unstranded
rna_counts <- as.data.frame(rna_counts)

# Read rna_genes
rna_genes <- rna_se@rowRanges@elementMetadata
rna_genes <- as.data.frame(rna_genes)

```


*2*
In this assignment, you will run differential expression analysis comparing patient samples by whether the sample is from a tumor or normal tissue (this is the definition column in rna_clinical). You will need to choose a variable to control for covariance of: age and/or PAM50 subtype (paper_BRCA_Subtype_PAM50). 

Manipulate those columns so that they are ready for differential expression analysis (hint: what kind of variables are they? what data type are they by default? do you need to handle unknown values?) Filter out genes with a total expression across all patients less than 1000.
```{r}
# Create masks for "treatments", "primary site", and "disease_type"
treatments_mask <- ifelse(colnames(rna_clinical) == 'treatments', F, T)
rna_clinical <- rna_clinical[, treatments_mask]

primary_mask <- ifelse(colnames(rna_clinical) == 'primary_site', F, T)
rna_clinical <- rna_clinical[, primary_mask]

disease_mask <- ifelse(colnames(rna_clinical) == 'disease_type', F, T)
rna_clinical <- rna_clinical[, disease_mask]

# Remove Solid Tissue Normal samples
rna_clinical_definition <- ifelse(rna_clinical$definition == "Solid Tissue Normal", F, T)
rna_clinical <- rna_clinical[rna_clinical_definition,]
rna_counts <- rna_counts[, rna_clinical_definition]

# Set Rownames & Colnames
rownames(rna_genes) <- rna_genes$gene_id
rownames(rna_counts) <- rna_genes$gene_id
colnames(rna_counts) <- rownames(rna_clinical)

# Get rid of values lower than 10 & get rid of any NAs 
vital_mask <- !is.na(rna_clinical$vital_status)
rna_clinical <- rna_clinical[vital_mask,]
rna_counts <- rna_counts[, vital_mask]

gender_mask <- !is.na(rna_clinical$gender)
rna_clinical <- rna_clinical[gender_mask,]
rna_counts <- rna_counts[, gender_mask]
                        
count_mask <- ifelse(rowSums(rna_counts) < 10, F, T)
rna_genes <- rna_clinical[count_mask,]
rna_counts <- rna_counts[count_mask,]

#Experimental Design - observing "tissue or organ of origin"; covariate being gender and vital status;
rna_clinical$vital_status <- factor(rna_clinical$vital_status)
rna_clinical$gender <- factor(rna_clinical$gender)
```


*3*
Perform the differential expression analysis, All you need to do is fill in the appropriate # terms
```{r}
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = rna_counts,
                              colData = rna_clinical,
                              design= ~gender + vital_status)

dds_obj <- DESeq(dds)

resultsNames(dds_obj)

results <- results(dds_obj, format = "DataFrame", contrast = c("vital_status", "Alive", "Dead"))

results <- data.frame(results)
```

Prepare results dataframe for EnhancedVolcano plotting. Add two columns, "-log10(padj)" and "gene_name". Fill in these columns appropriately.
```{r}

head(results)

# Calculate -log10(padj)
results$`-log10(padj)` <- -log10(results$padj)

# Use the existing gene_name column
results$gene_name <- rownames(results)
```

*4*
Now we will use the EnhancedVolcano package to plot our results. The code is already completed and should run without adjustment if all code up to here is correct.
```{r}

#Installing EnhancedVolcano
library(ggplot2)
library(EnhancedVolcano)

#Creating VolcanoPlot
EnhancedVolcano(results,
                lab = results$gene_name,
                x = 'log2FoldChange',
                y = '-log10(padj)',
                title = 'Sample Definition: Tumor vs Normal Tissue',
                pointSize = 1.0,
                labSize = 5.0)


```

# Explain what genes from each part of the Volcano Plot mean in terms of their significance and up/down regulation. 
top-right genes: These genes have a high statistical significance (low p-values) and are upregulated.
bottom-right genes: These genes have high statistical significance but are downregulated.
top-left genes: These genes are have high statistical significance and are downregulated.
bottom-left genes: These genes have low statistical significance and are downregulated.
top-middle genes: These genes have high statistical significance but are neither strongly upregulated nor downregulated.
bottom-middle genes: These genes are not significantly expressed and have low fold-change.

Save the picture of the volcano plot (using either ggsave() or right clicking and manually downloading the image and push this .Rmd and the image to GitHub)
